<h3 align="center">Features Included in This Game:</h3><br>
<b>Two-Player Mode</b>: Players alternate turns, marking either "X" or "O" in a 3x3 grid. The game ensures fair play by disabling already occupied cells.<br>

<b>Automatic Win Detection</b>: The game automatically checks for a winner after each move by scanning all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, and diagonals). Once a player wins, the game highlights the winning pattern and displays a victory message.<br>

<b>Draw Condition Handling</b>: If all the grid spaces are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw and notifies the players.<br>

<b>Restart Button</b>: The restart option resets the game board while maintaining the current session, allowing players to start over instantly without reloading the webpage.<br>

<b>New Game Functionality</b>: This feature clears the game board and resets all previous progress, effectively beginning a completely new session.<br>

This game is lightweight, interactive, and a great example of a JavaScript-powered mini-project! ðŸš€<br><br>
